**DonutVisualizer: A Mesmerizing ASCII Donut Animation**

Step into the world of ASCII artistry with **DonutVisualizer**, a captivating Java program that brings a rotating 3D torus (donut) to life on your terminal. This ingenious piece of code combines the beauty of trigonometry and real-time rendering to create an endless loop of dynamic visual splendor. 

### **Features:**
1. **Hypnotic Rotation**: Watch the donut gracefully spin around both the x-axis and z-axis, creating a mesmerizing visual experience.
2. **ASCII Shading**: Uses a luminance ramp (`.,-~:;=!*#$@`) to mimic realistic lighting, giving depth and texture to the donut as it rotates.
3. **Real-Time Rendering**: Continuously updates the animation with smooth transitions, leveraging clever math for projection and perspective.
4. **Terminal Magic**: Displays a seamless, single-frame rotating donut without artifacts or overlapping, clearing and refreshing your terminal like a pro.

### **How It Works:**
- **Mathematics in Action**: The program uses a combination of trigonometric functions to calculate the 3D coordinates of points on the torus and then projects them into 2D space.
- **Lighting & Shading**: Calculates surface normals and luminance values for realistic shading, dynamically adjusting the brightness based on the donut's orientation.
- **Optimized Performance**: Depth buffering ensures that the closest parts of the donut are displayed, while an efficient loop structure keeps the animation smooth.

### **Why It's Cool:**
- Combines coding, mathematics, and art to create a stunning, lightweight animation that runs directly in your terminal.
- A perfect example of how simple characters and mathematical formulas can produce complex, visually appealing results.
- Offers a unique hands-on experience to explore concepts like 3D projection, shading, and depth bufferingâ€”all in a single Java program.

Run **DonutVisualizer** in your terminal and prepare to be mesmerized by the hypnotic spin of this ASCII marvel!
